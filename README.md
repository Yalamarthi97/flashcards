# hiring-sriharsha-y-flashcards

Added skeleton code for BE
Added skeleton code for FE


for now checking only under cards table but need to check under forgotten cards as well as we should not create the card with same value and desc if it is forgotten or already present

Set time limit for myself -> 7 hours 

Hour 1 + 20 mins:  Time left approx -> 5 hours 40 mins

1. Looked into the logic on how i can achieve the card one after the other
2. Created the DB
3. Added psql driver and some decorators for it
4. Created 2 docker-compose files , one for psql and other for backend
5. Added cards view and url
6. Troubelshooting on why flask was not restarting
7. Worked on creating the tables into the psql instance and storing the data
8. Updated requirements.txt 
9. Tried connecting to psql through docker ( i kinda was left searching for some answers on the internet)
10. Iterated over various ways on how  i can acheive this project

Spent 25 mins, looking into the schema for the db , altering the existing one and trying to create queries
Combined both the tables into 1 as I felt having 2 seperate right now might not be required.
